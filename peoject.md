Design a clean, modern productivity dashboard web app for a university student managing classes, changing work shifts, coursework deadlines, and a final-year AI dissertation project.
The app should include:

Colour-coded blocks:

Blue → university classes

Red → coursework deadlines / exam weeks

Yellow → weekly work shifts (varying hours)

Green → project study blocks (AI dissertation tasks)

Grey → rest / personal time

Ability to drag and resize blocks

Clean modern UI with soft shadows, rounded corners

Navigation tabs: Week View, Month View, Deadlines

Top bar shows current week, date selector, profile icon

2. A Project Management Board (Trello-style Kanban)

Columns should be:
